# Am I Musk's Child?

This is a simple game that uses a model trained on Kaggle to detect, from a face picture, whether the person in the image could theoretically be a child of Elon Musk.
The model primarily determines if the person in the image is younger than 30 years old. If they are, the app concludes the person could be a child of Elon.

You can learn more about how the model was trained [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samiaxas/predict-age-range).

You can play the game online [here](https://amimuskchild.publicvm.com/).

## About the Code

This project consists of:

1. **Backend**: A Django REST Framework (DRF) app with one endpoint. The backend:
   - Accepts the submitted image.
   - Performs the required preprocessing.
   - Passes the processed image to the model.
   - The classifier predicts one of two labels.

2. **Frontend**: A simple Vue.js application for the user interface.

Everything is Dockerized to simplify setup and deployment.

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

1. Set up the required `.env` files.

For the backend (`.env`):
```plaintext
ALLOWED_HOSTS=blas.local
MODE=dev
SECRET_KEY=somesecrethere
```

For the frontend (.env):
```plaintext
plaintext
Copy code
VITE_AUTH_APP=whatever
VITE_AUTH_APP_ID=whatever
VITE_AUTH_APP_SECRET=whatever
```
Replace whatever with the values generated by oauth2_provider when setting up the application. Refer to the [Django OAuth Toolkit documentation](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for details.

2. Build and Start Docker Containers:
```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

3. Start the Django Backend:
```bash
docker exec -it amimuskchild-ba bash
./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
```

4. Start the Vue.js Frontend:
```bash
docker exec -it amimuskchild-fa sh
yarn  # Run this if Node modules are not already installed
yarn dev
```
